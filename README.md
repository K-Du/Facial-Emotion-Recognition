# Facial-Emotion-Recognition
Metis Project #3 - Image classification with neural networks
 
Code is based on the official Tensorflow tutorial code for CIFAR-10 [(link)](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/r0.11/tensorflow/models/image/cifar10/). It has been adjusted to work on the FER2013 dataset and to make better use of my GPU (GTX 1080). Also fixed some errors caused by Tensorflow version update.
